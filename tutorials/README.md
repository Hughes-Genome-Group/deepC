# deepC - Tutorials
Tutorials for the basic deepC workflows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

These tutorials follow the workflow I use for deepC predictions, analysis and visualizations.

The deep learning framework and the deepC predictions itself are run via python scripts.

The downstream analysis and visualizations is done within R using tidyverse and custom functions for working with deepC predictions and HiC data in general.

The tutorials use the *current_version* scripts for tensorflow 1.14. If you are running on 1.8 just switch the script links to the legacy version.


### Access

Checkout the html files from your repo clone or download the html files. It has some plots that lead to a bigger file size so gitHub can't visualize it straight online.

Alternatively run the R markdown files within e.g. R studio.
