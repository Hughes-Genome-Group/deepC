# deepC - Tutorials
Tutorials for the basic deepC workflows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The tutorials follow the workflow I use for deepC predictions, analysis and visualizations. 

The deep learning framework and the deepC predictions itself are run via python scripts.

The downstream analysis and visualizations is done within R using tidyverse and custom functions for working with deepC predictions and HiC data in general.

Checkout the html files from your repo clone or download the html files. It has some plots that lead to a bigger file size so gitHub can't visualize it straight online.
